### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with the git fetching and merging a bit, but the guide clarified that fetching fetches from a remote repo, and then merging merges the master of the remote repo to a specific local branch.
### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
All git commands that we have gone through so far were clarified during the GPS.  Also, good googling/scanning for answers was clarified.  Branch use when working within development teams was also conversed about.
### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my guide and pair why we use branches in the first place, as well as what are good googling techniques for looking up commands you do not know.  Also, I asked why we have to fetch and merge branches.
### What still confuses you about git?
Merging still confuses me a little bit, as if you type `git merge branch_name` while on the master branch, does the branch_name write upon the master, or does the master write upon the branch_name?  Either way, the changes end up in the master branch and the branch_name.
### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first experience of pairing in a GPS was extremely positive.  I really enjoyed going through a challenge with a parter who is at the same level of coding as I am.  It helped to have a guide there as well to answer our questions even though he was only there for about half of the session.  It solidifies concepts by talking to others, and also having a pair to correct your mistakes is a great backup.
