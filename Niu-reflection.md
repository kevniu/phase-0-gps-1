### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I hadn't really used git fetch and merge prior to the GPS and hadn't really collaborated with someone else on working on a repo. The guide gave a good explanation of how the syntax for fetch and merge work.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The GPS clarified how branching works when you have multiple users working on the same project and about merging those branches.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my guide and pair on better technqiues for googling and scanning through webpages to find the information I needed. He also was able to give us some command shortcuts that were useful and proper syntax for markdown.

### What still confuses you about git?
The concept of merging is still a bit confusing as the syntax seems a little backwards to me; whether you are merging changes from the master into the feature or vice versa.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was definitely a good experience for me. The guide was able to help us out with syntax and useful information when we needed it. My partner also seemed to be at the same level as me in terms of technical skills and I thought we communicated very well between our roles.
